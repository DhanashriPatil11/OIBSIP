## 💡 Projects  

### 🏷️ Task 1: Online Reservation System  

**Description**:  
An online system designed for hassle-free ticket reservations and cancellations. It simplifies the process with a centralized database for storing user and journey data.  

**Features**:  
- 🔑 **Login Form**: Secure access with unique login credentials.  
- 📝 **Reservation System**: Auto-populates train names based on train numbers and confirms reservations with a click.  
- ❌ **Cancellation System**: Retrieves and cancels tickets

### 🎯 Task 2: Number Guessing Game  

**Description**:  
The "Number Guessing Game" is a simple yet engaging Java application that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number by the computer. It combines logic and luck, making it a fun and interactive project.  

---

#### 💡 How It Works  

1. The system generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).  
2. The user is prompted to guess the number through a displayed input box.  
3. Feedback is provided after each guess:  
   - If the guess is correct, the user wins the round.  
   - If the guess is incorrect, the system indicates whether the number is **higher** or **lower**.  
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts (if a limit is set).

### 🏦 Task 3: ATM Interface  

**Description**:  
This console-based Java application simulates an ATM system, allowing users to perform essential banking operations like withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and viewing transaction history. Built using five different classes, the project emphasizes modular programming and object-oriented principles.  

---

#### 🛠️ Functionalities  

1. **Login System**:  
   - Users must enter a valid user ID and PIN to access the ATM functionalities.  
   - Ensures secure access and prevents unauthorized usage.  

2. **Transaction History**:  
   - Displays a record of all transactions (withdrawals, deposits, and transfers) during the session.  

3. **Withdraw**:  
   - Allows users to withdraw a specified amount, ensuring sufficient balance availability.  

4. **Deposit**:  
   - Enables users to deposit money into their account and updates the balance accordingly.  

5. **Transfer**:  
   - Facilitates transferring funds to another account securely and efficiently.  

6. **Quit**:  
   - Provides an option to exit the application gracefully.

  ### 📝 Task 4: Online Examination  

**Description**:  
The **Online Examination** system is a Java-based console application designed to conduct exams efficiently. The application allows users to log in, update their profile, participate in an MCQ-based test with a timer, and securely log out after completing their session.  

---

#### 🛠️ Functionalities  

1. **Login**:  
   - Users authenticate with a valid ID and password to access the examination system.  

2. **Update Profile and Password**:  
   - Users can update their personal details and reset their password securely.  

3. **MCQ Selection**:  
   - Users answer multiple-choice questions by selecting the appropriate option.  
   - Validates and stores responses during the session.  

4. **Timer and Auto Submit**:  
   - A countdown timer runs during the exam.  
   - Automatically submits answers when the timer runs out.  

5. **Session Closing and Logout**:  
   - Ensures all session data is saved securely before logging out.
